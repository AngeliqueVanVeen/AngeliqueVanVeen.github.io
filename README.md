# AngeliqueVanVeen.github.io
A responsive website with 1 to 5 articles in one row.

This is an example of a website that I made, where the homepage contains articles in which there is space for an image, 
a short piece of text and a Read more button. The other pages have a navigation menu on the left.

The website is responsive so that it can be viewed on all devices.

This repository is the same as the one named articles.
